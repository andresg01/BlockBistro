# BlockBistro
A dynamic instant booking platform for the hospitality industry that integrates a Dapp (in the solana blockchain) for an auction system for each space (tables for example) in the different hospitality establishments. With this platform, customers will be able to visualise the different tables in a visual and interactive way, showing the layout of the tables and see if they are occupied or free in real time so that they can make the reservation they want. Customers who are occupying a table can also choose to auction their seat for when they vacate it, a very good way to encourage participation and consumption in establishments that have implemented this platform at times of high demand.
